	Scenario Outline: Add two numbers with templating
		Given the first number is: <first_number>
		And the second number is: <second_number>
		When the two numbers are added
		Then the result should be: <sum>

		Examples:
			| first_number | second_number | sum | comment                                               |
			| 50           | 70            | 120 | Happy path                                            |
